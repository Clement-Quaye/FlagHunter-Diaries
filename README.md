## File System Flags 📂

#### Overview
In this challenge, the objective is to navigate through a complex file system and locate hidden flags. The ability to find these flags showcases proficiency in navigating and manipulating the Linux file systems, a vital skill in the realm of cybersecurity.

#### Flags Structure
All flags in this CTF follow the structure: `{T415_15_a_te5t}`. 

#### Task Details
- **Objective**: Find 4 system flags.
  
### i. Finding Flag#1 `find_flag.txt`

- **Commands Used**: 
  ```bash
  find / -name find_flag.txt 2>/dev/null
  cat path/to/find_flag.txt
- *Comments: I used the standard error data stream (stderr==2) to redirect/discard all error messages [due to priviledge limitations] to the /dev/null special file*

  - *Flag_1*: {F1nd_Fl4g_Fun}
    
### ii. Finding Flag#2 `find_flag.txt` 

### A - FIRST ATTEMPT (Find /)
- **Initial Commands Used**: 
  ```bash
  find / -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -H "{*}" {} \;
  #Command Breakdown:
  : <<'END_COMMENT' #using the here document ('<<') as a workaround for multi-line comments
  1. find / -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null --> this block runs a search for txt files using the * wildcard
  2. -exec --> This option/command lets me execute another command on each file that matches the find conditions (no. 1)
  3. grep --> tool for searching specific patterns within files
  4. -H --> option/switch tells 'grep' to print the name of the file along with the matching line
  5. "{*}" --> this argument represents the search pattern [not to be confused with the next one which is a placeholder]
  6. {} --> a placeholder that 'find' uses to hold the current file being processed. When 'grep' is executed {} will be replaced with the current ".txt" file
  7. \; --> end of the --exec command ('\' is an escape sequence for the semicolon)
  END_COMMENT

- *Comments: The output of this command, although successful, is not an optimal (time-efficient) solution to finding the File System Flags*

  ### B - SECOND ATTEMPT (Find /home)
- **Initial Commands Used**: 
  ```bash
  find /home -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -H "{*}" {} \;

- *Comments: The output of this command gave me all three (3) remaining File System Flags (within the /home directory)*

#### File System FlagsList - ALL FOUR FLAGS
  ##### a. *Flag_1*: {F1nd_Fl4g_Fun} -- *[directory: /var/backups/find_flag.txt]*
  ##### b. *Flag_2*: {St0ry_Fl4g} -- *[directory: /home/ctf/flag/story.txt]*

  ##### d. *Flag_4*: {H1d3_1n_pl41n_s1gh7} -- *[directory: /home/ctf/.f.txt] -hidden file*


## Webpage Flags 🕸️

#### Overview
In this challenge, the objective is to uncover flags concealed within webpages. These flags can be tucked away in various places, such as HTML comments or hidden pages. Successfully locating these flags highlights proficiency in web application security and a deep understanding of data handling on the web.

#### Task Details

#### i. Flag from HTML Pages and Comments (/var/www)
- **Objective**: Search the source code of webpages to find flags hidden within HTML comments.
- **Method Used**: 
  ```bash
  find /var/www/html -name "*.html" 2> /dev/null -exec grep -H {*} {} \;

- *Comments: Although the output of this command is also not an optimal (time-efficient) solution to finding the Webpage Flags; it does serve as a good cue on which directory and HTML pages to Inspect*
